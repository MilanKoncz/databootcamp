## Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

### How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

2. The game board has 9 positions numbered 1-9:
   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```

3. Players take turns entering a position number (1-9) to place their mark (X or O).

4. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

5. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

6. You can quit the game at any time by entering 'q'.

7. After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.
